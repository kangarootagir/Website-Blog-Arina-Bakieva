Site Blog of Arina Bakieva http://arina.bakieva.tilda.ws/children
I contributed to this project as a JavaScript Developer. Despite the fact that the site was written in Tilda, I wrote the project logic in JavaScript at the request of the designer. Also, thanks to me, the cats on the site started talking :)
